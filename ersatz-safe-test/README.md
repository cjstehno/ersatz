# Safe Testing

> This project exists to verify and test the "safe" jar artifact generation and usage.

FIXME: make 4 test projects under this (renamed) directory

`/usage-tests`
    `ersatz`
    `ersatz-safe`
    `ersatz-groovy`
    `ersatz-groovy-safe`

These will test the usage of the library from local maven repo

will need to make sure all published to local before testing
these will not be part of the main build... but maybe later?
