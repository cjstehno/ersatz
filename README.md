## Introduction

The Ersatz Server is a HTTP client testing tool which allows for request/response expectations to be configured in a 
flexible manner. The expectations will respond in a configured manner to requests and allow testing with different 
responses and/or error conditions without having to write a lot of boiler-plate code.

> **Warning:** v3.x is **NOT** directly backwards compatible with the 2.x releases. Some lesser-used features have been 
> removed and the Groovy DSL has been extracted into its own extension library - see the 
> [What's New in 3.0](http://cjstehno.github.io/ersatz/docs/user_guide.html/#_in_3.0) section of the User Guide for 
> details and a migration guide.

> **Warning:** v2.x has removed some unused features of the library and extracted the Groovy support into it's own 
> extension library. See the [What's New in 2.0](http://cjstehno.github.io/ersatz/docs/user_guide.html/#_in_2.0) section
