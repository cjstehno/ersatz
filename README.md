## Introduction

The Ersatz Server is a HTTP client testing tool which allows for request/response expectations to be configured in a 
flexible manner. The expectations will respond in a configured manner to requests and allow testing with different 
responses and/or error conditions without having to write a lot of boiler-plate code.

> **Warning:** v3.x is **NOT** directly backwards compatible with the 2.x releases. Some lesser-used features have been 
> removed and the Groovy DSL has been extracted into its own extension library - see the 
> [What's New in 3.0](http://cjstehno.github.io/ersatz/docs/user_guide.html#_in_3.0) section of the User Guide for 
> details and a migration guide.

## Getting Started

Project artifacts are available via the Maven Central repository. Below are the dependency coordinates for Gradle and 
Maven, more details are provided in the 
[Getting Started](http://cjstehno.github.io/ersatz/docs/user_guide.html#_getting_started) section of the User Guide.

### Gradle

    testImplementation 'io.github.cjstehno.ersatz:ersatz:3.0.0'

    // or, for the Groovy DSL extensions
    testImplementation 'io.github.cjstehno.ersatz:ersatz-groovy:3.0.0'

### Maven

    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.github.cjstehno.ersatz</groupId>
        <artifactId>ersatz</artifactId>
        <version>3.0.0</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
    
    <!-- or, for the Groovy DSL extensions -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.github.cjstehno.ersatz</groupId>
        <artifactId>ersatz-groovy</artifactId>
        <version>3.0.0</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>

### Shadowed

There is a `safe` (shadowed) version of each library available, which is useful in cases where you already  have a version of Undertow in use (to avoid version collisions). See the [Shadow Jar](http://cjstehno.github.io/ersatz/docs/user_guide.html#_shadow_jar)
section of the User Guide for more information.

## Build Instructions

Ersatz is built using Gradle:

    ./gradlew clean build

Or, if the "shadow" artifact is desired:

    ./gradlew clean build shadowJar

If you are interested in building the web site, with all documentation and reports, you can run the following:

    ./gradlew site

In order to build specific reports, run the appropriate one of the following:

    ./gradlew asciidoctor
    ./gradlew javadoc
    ./gradlew jacocoTestReport
    ./gradlew test
    
## Publishing

### To Local Maven Repo

You can publish the all the source, javadoc, "safe" and regular jars to your local maven repository (`~/.m2/repository` directory) using the following command:

    ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
    
    // or, if you have not built recently
    ./gradlew clean build publishToMavenLocal

### To Maven Central
