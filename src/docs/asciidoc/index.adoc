== Introduction

The Ersatz Server is a HTTP client testing tool, which allows for request/response expectations to be configured in a flexible manner. The expectations
will respond in a configured manner to requests and allow testing with different responses and/or error conditions without having to write a lot of
boiler-plate code.

The "mock" server is not really mock at all, it is an embedded Undertow HTTP server which registers the configured expectations as routes and then
responds according to the expected behavior. This approach may seem overly heavy; however, testing an HTTP client can involve a lot of internal state
and interactions that the developer is generally unaware of (and should be) - trying to mock those interactions with a pure mocking framework will get
out of hand very quickly.

Ersatz provides a balance of mock-like expectation behavior with a real HTTP interface and all of the underlying interactions in place. This allows
for rich unit testing, which is what you were trying to do in the first place.

Ersatz is written in Groovy 2.4.x and requires a Java 8 VM due to its use of the modern functional libraries; however, the Ersatz library is written
such that it may be used with Groovy or standard Java without pain or feature-loss. With that in mind, the expectation configuration allows two main
forms, a Java-style chained builder, and a Groovy DSL, both of which may be used interchangeably or together, if you are using Groovy.

Ersatz is developed with testing in mind. It does not favor any specific testing framework, but it does work well with both the JUnit and Spock
frameworks.

== Getting Started

The `ersatz` library is available via Bintray (JCenter) and the Maven Central Repository; you can add it to your project using one of the following:

For Gradle:

    testCompile 'com.stehno.ersatz:ersatz:0.4.3'

For Maven:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.stehno.ersatz</groupId>
        <artifactId>ersatz</artifactId>
        <version>0.4.3</version>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>

You could then use Ersatz in a Spock test as follows:

[source,groovy]
.HelloSpec.groovy
----
class HelloSpec extends Specification {

    def 'say hello'(){
        setup:
        ErsatzServer ersatz = new ErsatzServer()

        server.expectations {
            get('/say/hello'){
                called equalTo(1)
                query 'name','Ersatz'
                responder {
                    content 'Hello Ersatz','text/plain'
                }
            }
        }

        ersatz.start()

        when:
        String result = "${ersatz.serverUrl}/say/hello?name=Ersatz".toURL().text

        then:
        result == 'Hello Ersatz'

        and:
        ersatz.verify()

        cleanup:
        ersatz.stop()
    }
}
----

The server is expecting a single call to `GET /say/hello?name=Ersatz`, and when it is received, the server will respond with the `text/plain` content
`Hello Ersatz`. This code also verifies that the expected request was only called once (as requested) - if it was not called or called more than once,
the verification and likewise the test, would fail.

The expectation configured above could also be written using the chained builder approach (in Java), as follows:

[source,java]
----
server.expectations(expect -> {
    expect.get("/say/hello").called(equalTo(1)).query("name","Ersatz")
        .responds().content("Hello Ersatz","text/plain");
))
----

The two formats are interchangeable.

== Server Lifecycle

The lifecycle of an Ersatz server is broken down into four main states:

1. Configure
2. Test
3. Verify
4. Cleanup

they are detailed in the next sections.

=== Configure

The first step is "configuration", where the server is instantiated, request expectations are configured and the server is started. An Ersatz server
is created by creating an instance of `ErsatzServer` with an optional `ServerConfig` passed in to provide initial configurations (such as global
encoder and decoder configurations).

No HTTP server is started at this point, but the server is ready for configuration. Configuring the expectations on the server consists of calling one
of the following methods:

[source,groovy]
----
ErsatzServer expectations(final Consumer<Expectations> expects)

ErsatzServer expectations(@DelegatesTo(Expectations) final Closure closure)

Expectations expects()
----

The first allows for configuration within a `Consumer<Expectations>` instance, which will have a prepared `Expectations` instance passed into it. This
allows for a DSL-style configuration from Java.

The second method is the entry point for the Groovy DSL configuration. The provided `Closure` will delegate to an instance of `Expectations` for
defining the configurations.

The third method is a simplified builder-style approach for single request method expectation-building.

Once the request expectations are configured, the server must be started by calling the `ErsatzServer` `start()` method. This will start the underlying
embedded HTTP server and register the configured expectations. If the server is not started, you will receive connection errors during testing.

=== Testing

After configuration, the server is running and ready for test interactions. Any HTTP client can make HTTP requests against the server to retrieve
configured responses. The `ErsatzServer` object provides helper methods to retrieve the server port and URL, with `getHttpPort()` and `getHttpUrl()`
respectively (there are also versions for HTTPS). Note that the server will _always_ be started on an ephemeral port so that a random one will be
chosen to avoid collisions.

=== Verify

Once testing has been performed, it may be desirable to verify whether or not the expected number of request calls were matched. The `Expectations`
interface provides a `called` method to add call count verification per configured request, something like:

[source,groovy]
----
post('/user').body(content, 'application/json').called(1)
    .responds().content(successContent, 'application/json')
----

This would match a POST request to "/user" with request body content matching the provided content and expect that matched call only once. When
`verify()` is called it will return `true` if this request has only been matched once, otherwise it will return `false`. This allows testing to
ensure that requests are not made more often than expected or at unexpected times.

Verification is optional and may simply be skipped if not needed.

=== Cleanup

After testing and verification, when all test interactions have completed, the server must be stopped in order to free up resources. This is done by
calling the `stop()` method of the `ErsatzServer` class. This is an important step as odd test failures have been noticed during multi-test runs if
the server is not properly stopped. In Spock you can create the `ErsatzServer` with the `@AutoCleanup` annotation to aid in proper management:

[source,groovy]
----
@AutoCleanup('stop') ErsatzServer server = new ErsatzServer()
----

likewise, in a JUnit test (Groovy or Java) you may use the `ErsatzServerRule` class, which is a https://github.com/junit-team/junit4/wiki/Rules[JUnit Rule]
implementation delegating to an `ErsatzServer`; it automatically calls the `stop()` method after each test method, though the `start()` method must
still be called manually.

[source,java]
----
@Rule ErsatzServerRule ersatzServer = new ErsatzServerRule()

@Test public void hello(){
    ersatzServer.expectations(expectations -> {
        expectations.get("/testing").responds().content("ok");
    }).start();

    okhttp3.Response response = new OkHttpClient().newCall(
        new Request.Builder().url(format("%s/testing", ersatzServer.getHttpUrl())).build()
    ).execute();

    assertEquals(200, response.code());
    assertEquals("ok", response.body().string());
}
----

The server may be restarted after it has been stopped; however, be aware that expectation configuration is additive and existing configuration will
remain on server start even if new expectations are configured.

== Expectations

Request expectations are the core of the Ersatz server functionality; conceptually, they are HTTP server request routes which are used to match an
incoming HTTP request with a request handler or to respond with a status of 404m, if no matching request was configured. The expectations are
configured on an instance of the `Expectations` interface, which provides multiple configuration methods for each of the supported HTTP request
methods (GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH), with the method name corresponding to the HTTP request method name. The four general types of
methods are:

* One taking a `String path` returning an instance of the `Request` interface
* One taking a `String path` and a `Consumer<Request>` returning an instance of the `Request` interface
* One taking a `String path` and a Groovy `Closure` returning an instance of the `Request` interface
* All of the above with the `String path` replaced by a Hamcrest `Matcher<String>` for matching the path

The `Consumer<Request>` methods will provide a `Consumer<Request>` implementation to perform the configuration on a `Request` instance passed into
the consumer function.

The `Closure` support is similar to that of the consumer; however, this is a Groovy DSL approach where the `Closure` operations are delegated onto the
a `Request` instance in order to configure the request.

All of the expectation method types return an instance of the request being configured (`Request` or `RequestWithContent`).

The primary role of expectations is to provide a means of matching incoming requests in order to respond in a desired and repeatable manner. They are
used to build up matching rules based on request properties to help filter and route the incoming request properly. http://hamcrest.org/[Hamcrest]
Matcher support allows for flexible request matching based on various request properties.

The configuration interfaces support three main approaches to configuration, a chained builder approach, such as:

[source,groovy]
----
head('/foo')
    .query('a','42')
    .cookie('stamp','1234')
    .respond().header('ok','true')
----

where the code is a chain of builder-style method calls used to wire up the request expectation. The second method is available to users of the Groovy
language, the Groovy DSL approach would code the same thing as:

[source,groovy]
----
head('/foo'){
    query 'a', '42'
    cookie 'stamp', '1234'
    responder {
        header 'ok', "true"
    }
}
----

which can be more expressive, especially when creating more complicated expectations. A third approach is a Java-based approach more similar to the
Groovy DSL, using the `Consumer<?>` methods of the interface, this would yield:

[source,java]
----
head('/foo', req -> {
    req.query("a", "42")
    req.cookie("stamp", "1234")
    req.responder( res-> {
        res.header("ok", "true")
    })
})
----

Any of the three may be used in conjunction with each other to build up expectations in the desired manner.

TIP: The matching of expectations is perform in the order the expectations are configured, such that if an incoming request could be matched by more
than one expectation, the first one configured will be applied.

Request expectations may be configured to respond differently based on how many times a request is matched, for example, if you wanted the first
request of `GET /something` to respond with `Hello` and second (and all subsequent) request of the same URL to respond with `Goodbye`, you would
configure multiple responses, in order:

[source,groovy]
----
get('/something'){
    responder {
        content 'Hello'
    }
    responder {
        content 'Goodbye'
    }
    called 2
}
----

Adding the `called` configuration adds the extra safety of ensuring that if the request is called more than our expected two times, the verification
will fail (and with that, the test).

== Url-Encoded Form Requests

Url-encoded form requests are supported by default when the request content-type is specified as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. The request
`body` expectation configuration will expect a `Map<String,String>` equivalent to the name-value pairs specified in the request body content. An
example would be:

[source,groovy]
----
server.expectations {
    post('/form') {
        body([alpha: 'some data', bravo: '42'], 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded')
        responder {
            content 'ok'
        }
    }
}
----

where the `POST` content data would look like:

    alpha=some+data&bravo=42

== Multipart Request Content

Ersatz server supports multipart file upload requests (`multipart/form-data` content-type) using the
https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-fileupload/[Apache File Upload] library on the "server" side. The expectations for multipart requests are
configured using the `MultipartRequestContent` class to build up an equivalent multipart matcher:

[source,groovy]
----
ersatz.expectataions {
    post('/upload') {
        decoders decoders
        decoder MULTIPART_MIXED, Decoders.multipart
        decoder IMAGE_PNG, Decoders.passthrough
        body multipart {
            part 'something', 'interesting'
            part 'infoFile', 'info.txt', TEXT_PLAIN, infoText
            part 'imageFile', 'image.png', IMAGE_PNG, imageBytes
        }, MULTIPART_MIXED
        responder {
            content 'ok'
        }
    }
}
----

which will need to exactly match the incoming request body in order to be considered a match. There is also a `MultipartRequestMatcher` used to
provide a more flexible Hamcrest-based matching of the request body:

[source,groovy]
----
server.expectations {
    post('/upload') {
        decoders decoders
        decoder MULTIPART_MIXED, Decoders.multipart
        decoder IMAGE_PNG, Decoders.passthrough
        body multipartMatcher {
            part 'something', notNullValue()
            part 'infoFile', endsWith('.txt'), TEXT_PLAIN, notNullValue()
            part 'imageFile', endsWith('.png'), IMAGE_PNG, notNullValue()
        }, MULTIPART_MIXED
        responder {
            content 'ok'
        }
    }
}
----

This will configure a match of the request body content based on the individual matchers, rather than overall equivalence.

A key point in multipart request support are the "decoders", which are used to decode the incoming request content into an expected object type.
Decoders are simply `BiFunction<byte[], DecodingContext, Object>` implementations - taking the incoming byte array, and a `DecodingContext` and
returning the decoded `Object` instance. Decoders may be registered in a shared instance of `RequestDecoders`, configured globally across the server
instance or configured on a per-request basis.

TIP: No decoders are provided by default, any used in the request content _must_ be provided in configuration.

Some common reusable decoders are provided in the `Decoders` utility class.

== Multipart Response Content

Multipart response content is supported, though most browsers do not fully support it - the expected use case would be a RESTful or other HTTP-based
API. The response content will have the standard `multipart/form-data` content type and format. The response content parts are provided using an
instance of the `MultipartResponseContent` class along with the `Encoders.multipart` multipart response content encoder (configured on the server or
response).

The content parts are provided as "field" parts with only a field name and value, or as "file" parts with a field name, content-type, file name and
content object. These configurations are made on the `MultipartResponseContent` object via DSL or functional interface.

The part content objects are serialized for data transfer as `String` content using configured encoders, which are simply instances of
`Function<Object,String>` used to do the object to string conversion. These are configured either on a per-response basis or by sharing a
`ResponseEncoders` instance between multipart configurations - the shared encoders will be used if not explicitly overridden by the multipart
response configuration. No part encoders are provided by default.

An example multipart response with a field and an image file would be something like:

[source,groovy]
----
ersatz.expectations {
    get('/data') {
        responder {
            encoder ContentType.MULTIPART_MIXED, MultipartResponseContent, Encoders.multipart
            content(multipart {
                // configure the part encoders
                encoder TEXT_PLAIN, CharSequence, { o -> o as String }
                encoder IMAGE_JPG, File, { o -> ((File)o).bytes.encodeBase64() }

                // a field part
                field 'comments', 'This is a cool image.'

                // a file part
                part 'image', 'test-image.jpg', IMAGE_JPG, new File('/test-image.jpg'), 'base64'
            })
        }
    }
}
----

The resulting response body would look like the following (as a String):

----
--WyAJDTEVlYgGjdI13o
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="comments"
Content-Type: text/plain

This is a cool image.
--WyAJDTEVlYgGjdI13o
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="image"; filename="test-image.jpg"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: base64
Content-Type: image/jpeg

... more content follows ...
----

which could be decoded in the same manner a multipart _request_ content (an example using the Apache File Upload multipart parser can be found in
the unit tests).

== Encoder/Decoder Chains

The request/response content body decoders/encoders are configured in a layered manner so that they may be configured and shared across multiple
instances without copying the configuration.

* Encoders/Decoders configured in the `ErsatzServer` constructor are considered "global" and will be used if no overriding handlers are configured.
* Encoders/Decoders configured in the request/response itself are considered "local" and will override any other configured handlers
* Other configurations are applied in a layered order based on where they are applied in the configuration DSL - the handlers are maintained as separate isolated instances and the actual handler is resolved at runtime.

== HTTPS Request Support

The `ErsatzServer` supports HTTPS requests when the `enableHttps()` configuration is set (either as `enableHttps()` or as `enableHttps true`). This
will setup both an HTTP and HTTPS listener both of which will have access to all configured expectations. In order to limit a specific request
expectation to HTTP or HTTPS, apply the `procotol(String)` matcher method with the desired protocol, for example:

[source,groovy]
----
server.expectations {
    get('/something').protocol('https').responding('thing')
}
----

which will match an HTTPS request to `GET /something` and send a response of `thing`.

NOTE: the HTTPS support is rudimentary and meant to test HTTPS endpoints, not any explicit features of HTTPS itself. Also your client will need to be able to ignore any self-signed certification issues in one way or another.

=== Creating a Custom Keystore

A default keystore is provided with the Ersatz library, and it should suffice for most cases; however, you may wish to provide your own custom keystore
for whatever reason. A supported keystore file may be created using the following command:

    ./keytool -genkey -alias <NAME> -keyalg RSA -keystore <FILE_LOCATION>

where `<NAME>` is the key name and `<FILE_LOCATION>` is the location where the keystore file is to be created. You will be asked a few questions about
the key being created. The default keystore name is `ersatz` and it has the following properties:

    CN=Ersatz, OU=Ersatz, O=Ersatz, L=Nowhere, ST=Nowhere, C=US

Obviously, it is only for testing purposes.

The keystore should then be provided during server configuration as:

[source,groovy]
----
ErsatzServer server = new ErsatzServer({
    enableHttps()
    keystore KEYSTORE_URL, KEYSTORE_PASS
})
----

where `KEYSTORE_URL` is the URL to your custom keystore file, and `KEYSTORE_PASS` is the password (maybe omitted if you used `ersatz` as the password).

== Feature Extensions

Additional server functionality may be added/configured on the server before startup. The `ServerFeature` interface provides this extension point;
however, the extension feature mechanism is experimental and may change in the future (efforts will be made to maintain a simple migration path if/when
this happens).

At this point there are two feature extension, the `BasicAuthFeature` and `DigestAuthFeature`, both discussed below.

TIP: Features are additive, so be careful about how features are applied.

=== BASIC Authentication

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication[HTTP BASIC Authentication] is supported by applying the `BasicAuthFeature` to the server.

[source,groovy]
----
def ersatz = new ErsatzServer({
    feature new BasicAuthFeature()
})
----

This configuration causes the configured request expectations to require BASIC authentication (username and password) as part of their matching.

=== DIGEST Authentication

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication[HTTP DIGEST Authentication] is supported by applying the `DigestAuthFeature` to the server.

[source,groovy]
----
def ersatz = new ErsatzServer({
    feature new BasicAuthFeature()
})
----

This configuration causes the configured request expectations to require DIGEST authentication (username and password) as part of their matching.
