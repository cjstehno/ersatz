FIXME: do these

Merge the projects back into one, just make JUnit not exported

* update readmes
* update site content
* update user guide for all sub-projects and content
* update all examples

* tests and coverage for all projects
* inspection for all projects (spotbugs, pmd, checkstyle)

* get builds/deployments working again
